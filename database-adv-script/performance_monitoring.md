- Over the past days I been going over and fine-tuning my database commands inorder to see the difference between action each commands performed. 

- Analyze and Explain is one commands that I might need to reuse a lot as it tells me how efficeint my queries are as it tell me the run time of the execution.

- Partitioning is one of a powerful tools that is handy with every database  system no matter the type of system you are working with. As we work with big data to quries and be able to make informed decision to reflect on current trends and business decisions.
